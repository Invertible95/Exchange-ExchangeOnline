# Exchange-ExchangeOnline
Collection of Powershell scripts dedicated to creating resources, shared mailboxes etc.

Hi, this is my first ever repository on GitHub.

This repository will be dedicated to scripts associated with On-premise exchange and Exchange Online.
The purpose of this particular repository is to store scripts that works well in an hybrid enviorment. 
The function is; usually when you for example create a shared mailbox on-prem, you have to migrate it to exchange online.
With the script added here named Create Shared Mailbox EXO, will create a remote mailbox and tag it as shared aswell as automatically synk it to Exchange Online.
In each script there should be clear instructions for each step.

Any feedback is welcome and I hope you get some use out of this.
I will try to keep the scripts up to date in accordance to changes with Microsoft and upload more.
If you find any errors or have a suggestion, please feel free to do a pull request.
You are more than welcome to contact me at theinvertible@gmail.com or with pull request if there is anything you think might be needing of improvement.
